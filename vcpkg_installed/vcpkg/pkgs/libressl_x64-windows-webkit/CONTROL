Description: LibreSSL is a TLS/crypto stack.
    It was forked from OpenSSL in 2014 by the OpenBSD project, with goals of modernizing the codebase, improving security, and applying best practice development processes.
    LibreSSL provides much of the OpenSSL 1.1 API. Incompatibilities between the projects exist and are unavoidable since both evolve with different goals and priorities.
